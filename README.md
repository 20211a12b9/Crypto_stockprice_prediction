# Crypto Price Prediction Project
****
## Overview
This project involves using web scraping to extract cryptocurrency data from a website, performing machine learning analysis to predict cryptocurrency prices, and creating a web application using Streamlit to visualize the predictions.
****
## Data Collection
The cryptocurrency data is collected by scraping a website that provides real-time cryptocurrency prices. This data includes information such as cryptocurrency names, prices, market cap, volume, and other relevant metrics.
*****
## Machine Learning Analysis
Using the collected cryptocurrency data, a machine learning model is trained to predict future cryptocurrency prices based on historical data. Various machine learning algorithms and techniques are applied to develop an accurate price prediction model.
******
## Web Application
A web application is developed using Streamlit to showcase the cryptocurrency price predictions in an interactive and user-friendly manner. Users can input parameters such as cryptocurrency name, date range, and prediction horizon to visualize the predicted prices and evaluate the performance of the model.
****
## Usage
* Data Collection: Run the web scraping script to collect real-time cryptocurrency data from the website.

* Machine Learning: Train the machine learning model using the collected cryptocurrency data and evaluate its performance.

* Web Application: Launch the Streamlit web application to visualize the cryptocurrency price predictions and interact with the model.
******
## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Libraries: Beautiful Soup, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit, Matplotlib .
